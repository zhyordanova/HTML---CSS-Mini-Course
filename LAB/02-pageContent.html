            <p>"Just Another Day" is a song by Cuban-American singer-songwriter Jon Secada. It was released in March
                1992 as
                the lead single from his self-titled debut album (1992). Written by Secada and Miguel Morejon, the song
                reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the Adult Contemporary chart. It also
                peaked at number one in Sweden, at number two in Canada, and at number five in the United Kingdom and
                New
                Zealand. The song was also recorded in Spanish as "Otro Día Más Sin Verte", which topped the US
                Billboard
                Hot Latin Tracks chart, peaked at number one in Panama and Uruguay, and reached the top-five in
                Colombia, El
                Salvador and Mexico. Gloria Estefan sings background vocals on the song and is given writing credit for
                the
                Spanish-language version.</p>

            <p>In addition to the primary blog, you can create secondary blogs on your account. Tumblr allows you to
                create
                up to ten secondary blogs per day. Secondary blogs lack some of the social features used by primary
                blogs:
                they are unable to like posts, follow other blogs, or send asks or submissions. However, secondary blogs
                can
                be password-protected, requiring a password to view the blog. You can add other Tumblr users to a
                secondary
                blog to create a group blog.</p>
